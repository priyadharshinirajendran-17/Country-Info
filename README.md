# Country Info Viewer – Fetch API

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for a country
and view its details using a public API. It demonstrates how to fetch external data
and dynamically update the web page using JavaScript.

## Features
- Search country by full name
- Displays country flag
- Shows capital, population, and region
- Uses Fetch API with async/await
- Loading indicator while fetching data
- Error handling for invalid country names
- Keyboard support (Enter key)

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Fetch API)

## API Used
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country}

## How It Works
- User enters a country name and clicks Search or presses Enter
- JavaScript sends a request to the public API using Fetch
- The response data is processed and displayed dynamically
- Errors are handled gracefully if the country is not found

## Purpose
This project was created as part of Task 10 to practice working with public APIs,
asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
